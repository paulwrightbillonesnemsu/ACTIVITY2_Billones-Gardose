# Flutter Lab Portfolio App — Setup Guide

This zip has the `lib/` source code and `pubspec.yaml` for your app, but it's
missing the platform folders (`android/`, `ios/`, etc.) that only the Flutter
CLI can generate. Follow these steps in order.

## 1. Install Flutter (skip if already installed)
Download and install the Flutter SDK from https://flutter.dev, then add it to
your PATH. Confirm it works:
```
flutter doctor
```
Fix anything it flags as missing (Android SDK, licenses, etc.).

## 2. Scaffold a fresh project
In a terminal, **outside** this extracted folder:
```
flutter create flutter_lab_portfolio
```
This generates the `android/`, `ios/`, `web/` folders and a default `lib/`
and `pubspec.yaml` you don't need.

## 3. Copy in the provided code
- Delete the generated `lib/` folder inside `flutter_lab_portfolio/` and
  replace it with the `lib/` folder from this zip.
- Replace the generated `pubspec.yaml` with the one from this zip.

## 4. Open in Android Studio
- Android Studio → Open → select the `flutter_lab_portfolio` folder.
- Let it index, then open a terminal inside Android Studio and run:
```
flutter pub get
```

## 5. Connect your phone
1. On your phone: Settings → About phone → tap "Build number" 7 times to
   unlock Developer Options.
2. Settings → Developer Options → enable **USB debugging**.
3. Plug the phone into your computer with a USB cable.
4. Accept the "Allow USB debugging?" prompt on the phone.
5. In Android Studio's device dropdown (top toolbar), your phone should now
   appear. Select it.

## 6. Run
Click the green ▶ Run button, or from the terminal:
```
flutter run
```
The app will build and launch directly on your phone.

## What's inside
- `lib/main.dart` – app entry point, wires up Provider + theming
- `lib/providers/app_state_provider.dart` – global state (theme mode, user
  profile, activity list) using `ChangeNotifier`
- `lib/models/activity.dart` – plain data model for an activity
- `lib/theme/app_theme.dart` – colors + light/dark `ThemeData`
- `lib/screens/main_screen.dart` – bottom nav host (`StatefulWidget`, holds
  local tab-index state)
- `lib/screens/dashboard_screen.dart` – Home tab, lists activities
- `lib/screens/activity_details_screen.dart` – pushed when "View Activity"
  is tapped
- `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart` – profile card + Light/Dark segmented
  toggle that drives the global theme
- `lib/widgets/activity_card.dart` – reusable `StatelessWidget` card

## How the state management requirement is satisfied
`AppStateProvider` extends `ChangeNotifier` and is provided at the root of
the widget tree in `main.dart`. The Settings screen calls
`appState.setThemeMode(...)`, which calls `notifyListeners()`. Because
`MyApp`, `DashboardScreen`, and `SettingsScreen` all call
`context.watch<AppStateProvider>()`, they rebuild instantly and the whole
app (including the Home Dashboard) reflects the new theme — satisfying the
"changing this value must instantly update the UI across the app"
requirement without any manual `setState` plumbing between screens.
